# Surfs Up

## Overview

For this project, we set out to find the temperatures year round for the Hawaiian Island of Oahu to discover the viability of a surfing and ice cream shop. The months of June and December were analyzed for this project.

Looking at the two charts you can see that the mean and the max temperatures only vary by around 8 degrees, which shows that the weather is generally pretty stable in both the summer and winter seasons.


## Summary

1) We need to still look for the spring and fall temperatures and get accurate reads on those before assuming the whole picture, but having the peak seasons analyzed and seeing a positive trend is good.

2) After finding out the spring and fall temps, there needs to be an analysis for the sustainability of whether or not the ice cream/surf shop will do well in non-peak seasons (such as spring and fall).

3) Next we should find out more about the precipitation for specific island locations, especially where the shop would be located. Weather affecting business is not only confined to just temperatures. If it is discovered that heavy rainfall or other tempestuous weather is prevelant in the area, then a location for the shop should be considered.
